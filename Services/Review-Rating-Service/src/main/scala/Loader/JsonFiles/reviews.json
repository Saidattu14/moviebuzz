Orson Welles never lived to see it completed. It's sad, but in retrospect, I see why. The Other Side of the Wind is brilliant in it's own little way, but it's far too esoteric. This film was for an audience, but we certainly aren't it. This is Orson Welles, and his film cohorts, fed up with the Hollywood system, and throwing up their middle fingers at them. At the same time, Welles was searching to make a masterpiece far ahead of it's time. What we get is the story of the premiere of a legendary filmmaker's last film. The film-within-the-film, also titled The Other Side of the Wind, is a colorful and erotic psychedelic fever dream about a Native American woman. I enjoyed this portion much more. You can see the imagination and enthusiasm for making something new and far-out from these scenes. The scenes that wrap around the film-within-a-film are in the style of a documentary, as we see industry folks and journalists quipping and arguing with each other. John Huston stars as Jake Hannaford, the jaded has been hot shot director who is obviously supposed to represent Welles himself. Huston is the brightest part of these scenes. On the whole, they are less imaginative, and feel so insular. It's unbalanced, and that's what really took me out of it. Historically, this is really fascinating stuff. To better understand it, I must consult the making-of companion doc on Netflix.","rating_value":"6","review_date":"12 May 2020","reviewer_name":"aciessi","reviewer_url":"/user/ur36246296/","short_review":"A Master's Last Stand.","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw5731400"},{"full_review":"","rating_value":"","review_date":"9 March 2021","reviewer_name":"RonellSowes","reviewer_url":"/user/ur120431365/","short_review":"Final Tragic Entry Into Welles' Career","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw6677190"},{"full_review":"","rating_value":"3","review_date":"9 November 2018","reviewer_name":"ejonconrad","reviewer_url":"/user/ur12643360/","short_review":"The Emporer has no clothes","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw4448015"},{"full_review":"","rating_value":"8","review_date":"28 April 2020","reviewer_name":"vonnoosh","reviewer_url":"/user/ur34196744/","short_review":"Orson Welles' Eyes Wide Shut","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw5685252"},{"full_review":"","rating_value":"7","review_date":"3 February 2019","reviewer_name":"thetick-65848","reviewer_url":"/user/ur89706886/","short_review":"An Orson Welles film that isn't \"an Orson Welles film\"","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw4623295"},{"full_review":"This is not a movie for everyone. Orson Welles knows exactly who will enjoy this movie. Those who will enjoy this movie are exactly who Orson Welles wants to connect with, people like him, those who truly love Cinema. The art of this movie is evident. It is wholly original in its progression and cinematography. It captures the essience and mind of surrealist directors especially in the 1970s beautifully. It's a virtual time capsule of a movie. It is unintentionally a period piece, love letter to an era now long dead. Yet, this movie is very intentionally trying to put off a chaotic, disorderly, and untidy attitude. It does so very pleasingly. I love this movie.

The first time you watch it, you feel like you've been thrown into somebody else's life, with very little explanation of who these people are. Nobody is around to explain the interrelationships (the loves, hates, and histories) among this avalanche of new faces that hits you within the first five minutes of the movie (in that sense, it mimics how - in real life - you need to figure these things out yourself). To really understand the film, one should watch it at least ten times. Then, you begin to discern the weight of the tragedy that is unfolding amidst the drunken merriment. This is a movie about the disastrous end of Jake Hannaford's life. The story is set during a party, a truly epic shindig organised by an important woman from his past named Zarah (we never learn why Zarah chose to organise the party; their past relationship is kept a mystery). The aim of the party was to celebrate Hannaford's birthday, celebrate his life, and - most importantly - renew his career. Yet, the whole thing backfires. There's numerous hints throughout the film that Hannaford is a Hollywood legend with a directorial career stretching back at least forty years. In the party, Hannaford is held up as a figure of worship and adulation. Yet, the man behind the legend - when his moment in the spotlight has finally come - is utterly incapable of living up to his ideal. In fact, the real Hannaford is a nasty piece of work. His macho fa√ßade is like the Great Pyramid of Cheops, built up over many years, and now totally unchangeable. Hiding his weakness and insecurity under his pyramid of machismo, Hannaford plays up the reckless, hard drinking, womanising persona with barely a realisation about how pathetic he looks in front of the young party crowd. Eventually, he dies three deaths in one night - a social death, a financial death, and finally his real death.","rating_value":"10","review_date":"13 July 2020","reviewer_name":"yrussell","reviewer_url":"/user/ur3343514/","short_review":"A beautiful depiction of the death of hope","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw5903750"},{"full_review":"","rating_value":"6","review_date":"4 November 2018","reviewer_name":"cultfilmfreaksdotcom","reviewer_url":"/user/ur27550947/","short_review":"Review of Welles's Netflix-acquired Other Side of the Wind","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw4437807"},{"full_review":"","rating_value":"4","review_date":"18 November 2018","reviewer_name":"henry8-3","reviewer_url":"/user/ur0351766/","short_review":"The Other Side of the Wind","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw4465543"},{"full_review":"","rating_value":"","review_date":"18 November 2019","reviewer_name":"ontoson","reviewer_url":"/user/ur5157799/","short_review":"Worth seeing, if you like O.W. a bit and aren't afraid of nonconventional movie-making.","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw5266308"},{"full_review":"","rating_value":"","review_date":"3 November 2018","reviewer_name":"Tail_End_Charlie","reviewer_url":"/user/ur63141485/","short_review":"Worth the Ride","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw4435172"},{"full_review":"Let me start by saying that I am a major Orson Welles fan. With a few notable exceptions, his films are true classics. And he continued making great films into the late 50s. In Touch of Evil, released in 1958, Welles continued to expand our cinematic vocabulary with astonishing camera work and dialog techniques. I was so excited by the prospect of a \"new\" Welles release that instead of waiting for the Netflix release, I paid 20 bucks times two to see this at a film festival with my better half. Oh. My. God. What a colossal stinky mess of a movie! Atrocious script (half of which is attributed to Welle's lady friend, Oja Kodar, whose expressionless acting is also featured in the film). Hugely self-conscious, stilted performances by Peter Bogdanovich, Edmund O'Brien, Cameron Mitchell and John Huston, to name just a few. And shaky artsy-fartsy camera work that is edited in such a frenetic style that I started looking for the closest exit after only a couple of minutes. The simple fact is, Welles' greatest work was done while he was under the control, or at least supervision, of the big studios. Somehow, that tension produced fascinating, character-driven films. Later, operating on his own, with no one but himself to answer to, Welles drifted on to \"message\" films - like F is for Fake, another turkey, although not as big a turkey as the work at hand. It is hard to say how much of the blame here lies with Bogdanovich and those others who took it upon themselves to complete the master's last film. Clearly, they made a hash of it, although my suspicion is they really didn't have much to work with. I cannot think of a single scene in the entire film that came across as relevant or believable. It pains me to say it, but this one would have been better left to disintegrate in the can.","rating_value":"2","review_date":"4 November 2018","reviewer_name":"jake_fantom","reviewer_url":"/user/ur48867866/","short_review":"A Bitter Disappointment","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw4438248"},{"full_review":"I haven't seen the whole movie yet, and this is one problem with it. It drags along into so many small characters and subplots, it's a chore to finish. The opening resembles Mr. A quite a bit, but we didn't need any modern references to take us out of the time it was set, like \"Before cellphones and ipods.\" It's unrealistic to think people who knew Welles could know what parts stayed and what parts could be cut. I don't know why people who knew a famous director would ride together in a school bus to his party, except as a way of introducing the characters and revealing their secret opinions about him. The yellow bus just might be spoofing the tour bus that people use to visit Hearst Castle, the model for Welles' epic Citizen Kane. I would like to be remembered if I were famous as someone who made movies that appealed to simple tastes and problems of ordinary people. Sad what a grandiose ego trip can do. I suppose it never occurred to those reviewing a hundred hours of footage that Welles might have intended to have a mystery open \"question mark\" ending for the film.. Late photography director Gary Graver said in an interview ten years ago the ending planned for this film was different then what I saw here.","rating_value":"5","review_date":"6 September 2019","reviewer_name":"hollywoodshack","reviewer_url":"/user/ur16347457/","short_review":"Mr. Arkadin meets This is Your Life","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw5102575"},{"full_review":"He was not allowed to complete this film in his lifetime, like many of his film projects also earlier had been obstructed by financial difficulties, censure or uncooperative producers. More than 30 years after his death this film was completed by arduous work of his friends and followers, piecing together an enormour amount of left over materials and making a film of it, but it definitely still carries the stamp of Orson Welles. You feel his direction in the structure, in the character of the leading character (John Huston) making his last film before death and in the enormous ensemble play. Many great old actors make themselves reminded here again like in a last chance show, like Edmond O'Brien at the end of his tether, Cameron Mitchell, while the one charcter standing out in in a great personality of integrity by herself is Lilli Palmer, whom John Huston calls 'mother'. The plot is a muddle, all the characters keep interfering with each other and talking a lot of nonsense, it's a mess of intrigue and chaotic interceptions, but ultimately the structure gets into shape and reaches the ordinary Orson Welles height of impression. It will take some time to digest this film, there is too much in it, but the ultimate impression must be of yet another Orson Welles masterpiece.","rating_value":"10","review_date":"24 July 2019","reviewer_name":"clanciai","reviewer_url":"/user/ur10491760/","short_review":"Orson Welles' last film is no freak show","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw5016526"},{"full_review":"Welles had something to say that only people like him would understand.

The best stories centered on the Walsh family, newly arrived in town, in particular fraternal twins Brandon (Jason Priestly) and Brenda (Shannen Doherty). The gang then included friends Kelly (Jennie Garth), Steve (Ian Ziering), Andrea (Gabrielle Carteris), Donna (Tori Spelling), David (Brian Austin Green) and moody Dylan (Luke Perry).

It would have been nice if all the main characters stayed with the show throughout its entire run. It seems that no one stays with a show throughout its entire run.

The kids become friends and enemies, fall in and out of love, and go through an endless series of crises as this small group somehow becomes personally involved in every newsworthy social issue from alcoholism to South African apartheid to pregnancy to AIDS. Jason Priestley was one of the coolest actors on this show and so was Ian Ziering! The best actresses on this show were Tiffani Amber Thiessen and Kathleen Robertson. Tiffani Amber Thiessen was also on another FOX series called Fastlane and Jason Priestley is currently on another good FOX series Tru Calling!

That was quite a sensation. A real American show, and about real American young people, like me or my pals. And what was the best thing in all that was that all those problems and joys that they had in their sunny California were very close and clear for us in colder Russia. We, men, soon fell in love with beautiful girls of the serial - Jenny Garth, Kathleen Robertson (who was especially cool as Claire Arnold, the rascally sweet daughter of President Arnold), Tori Spelling or any other lady in there. Girls went slightly mad (Do not bite me for this, I am just being kiddingly nostalgic!) with Luke Perry, Brian Austin Green or endearingly correct and always clean Jason Priestly. Well, all that the main characters had in the film was so clear and understandable for us - love, hate, school, money, family troubles, cowardice and friendship - no boundaries exist for such things. We followed each episode so closely and so attentively. Of course, the BH 90210 is not devoid of weaknesses - some roles are pretty shallow and some moments are way too sentimental. It seemed that each of the main heroes had to overcome all the possible and impossible hardships and ordeals in this life - drugs, sects, deaths, losses. Sometimes, it was too too much. Anyway, the serial still stands out well and still looks fresh and dear, which is a big asset of the film.","rating_value":"8","review_date":"26 September 2006","reviewer_name":"denis888","reviewer_url":"/user/ur11215533/","short_review":"A very good serial","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw1483692"},{"full_review":"I grew up with these guys, since their and my high school years were the same.

From sophomores  in high school to college graduates, I was hooked to the entire gang. I  will never forget Brandon, Kelly, Steve, Donna, Dylan, Valerie, David,  Brenda, Noah, or Clare.   In 1990, Aaron Spelling (Dynasty, Love Boat, Charlie's Angels)  unleashed the FOX teen drama Beverly Hills 90210, a show based on the  lives of the rich, snobbish high school students of Beverly Hills. Who  would have known the show would last 10 years? New to California,  siblings Brandon and Brenda made friends with the students of West  Beverly High. Through high school, David witnessed best buddy Scott  accidentally shoot himself, Donna kept her virginity, Brandon and  Andrea became great friends, Steve was the sexed up prankster, and  Brenda found out Dylan and Kelly were together when she was in Paris.  After graduating West Beverly, the gang moved onto college. Donna got  involved with abusive musician Ray, Brandon and Kelly dated, Brenda  moved away, Dylan got married only to have his bride shot and killed by  his rival, bitchy Valerie moved into the Walsh house and made enemies  with Kelly, Kelly's druggie boyfriend Colin got arrested, and many of  the gang had already had addictions (Dylan, Kelly, David, Valerie,  Colin). After college, the gang got out into the real world. Brandon  and Kelly nearly married, Dylan returned, Valerie accused Noah of rape,  Steve met and married Janet after getting her pregnant, Donna's sister  Gina moved to Beverly Hills, and in the end, Donna and David got  married.   The memories will never be forgotten.   Kelly getting shot at LAX, Donna loosing her virginity to David on  graduation night, Dylan's father \"killed\" in a car explosion, Kelly  caught in a fire at Steve's rave, Brenda/Dylan/Kelly/, Valerie and  Kelly rivalry, Andrea sleeping with married man, Gina slapping Kelly,  and David and Donna's series finale wedding.

After seeing 'The Way To Shadow Garden', I thought, okay, I can see where Lynch got his inspiration for Eraserhead. This is a psycho-sexual fever dream, where the protagonist arrives at his apartment, scans the room, anticipates that something potentially disturbing went on, and decides to gouge his eyes out, and retreats into a sort of garden of shadows (provided here via the means of reverse film). This is not a film for the faint of heart, but is an important one for film students who are interested in one of the early pioneers of experimental cinema.","rating_value":"10","review_date":"6 November 2007","reviewer_name":"Seamus2829","reviewer_url":"/user/ur5512905/","short_review":"A Voyage Into The Inner Mind","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw1759401"},{"full_review":"\"The Way to Shadow Garden\" is an 11-minute movie from over 60 years ago that was written and directed by Stan Brakhage extremely early in his career. It is very different compared to some of his later works. There is a lead actor in here, it has sound, it is in black-and-white and it somewhat has elements of a plot and story, only to mention some aspects. However, it is still not a success in terms of filmmaking and judging from this one, I don't see a great deal of talent. I personally found it rather bizarre and annoying than memorable or interesting. I do not think it is a deserving watch and I felt it dragged on more than one occasions.

The influence was clear but the violence more than implied as Brakhage began to move away from the ambiguous narrative of his first film Interim into the more nebulous and experimental field that would bring the art form to a place it had never been before. It's a heavy handed, brutish work that defies interpretation and while I find it pretentious and abrasive for the most part the sublime and powerful transition late in the film gives this viewer the feeling it is Brakhage's response to the paranoia surrounding the nuclear threat of the 50s.

A new big screen version seemed appropriate in this day and age with technology becoming more advanced and the franchise's mythology becoming more complex but honestly after watching this latest attempt I am left scratching my head as to how and why this was considered to be the best possible version they could have made. Story-wise it's pretty boring, its essentially a 'set-up' tale that stuck in first act mode throughout its entire runtime, it moves pretty fast and its a little hard to invest yourself to the characters because of it. The humor is really mean spirited and completely overdone, I like Kano as a character but often I found myself yelling \"shut up!\" at the screen. The action I have to say is not very impressive, a lot of it is pretty cut heavy and you do not really feel any sense of excitement or feel there is any danger for the heroic characters in this. Visually, it looks and feels a lot like a series from The CW, very few times really feel it warranted a big screen release on a cinematographic level.

This is a worthy \"student film\", but it is what it is, and it should never have been released in theaters. Everything about it is amateurish, including the acting, the directing, the script, and the cinematography. For example, the director seems to think that having one of the actors stare into the camera with his mouth open for 10 seconds is high drama (and he uses this technique repeatedly). I'm not saying that there is no audience for this movie. I'm guessing that sci-fi geek's, Star Wars fanatics, and amateur filmmakers will enjoy it despite its flaws.

Honestly, it would've worked better as a short, because Johnson's story isn't altogether that incredibly interesting, outside of his handful of days being shown around the sets of 'Close Encounters Of The Third Mind' and 'Star Wars'. These moments, for me, we're the highlights to the film, all the rest was just weak teen coming-of-age bluster that's been done better and to greater effect in other films/stories. Johnson's anecdotal experience of have the pure luck of being at the right place at the right time, really doesn't amount to anything more than just a, \"cool story, bro.\" moment. Given the title is laser-focused at the release of 'Star Wars', but the protagonist doesn't even get to see the film on THAT DATE not only lessens the impact of the title being relevant, it just further aggravates the audience. There's a point in the film where the protagonist is confused as to whether or not the film is even playing in his own town, but later is taken to the film at the same theater that was somehow mistakenly showing a Chuck Norris film instead. As other reviews have deftly pointed out, I feel like the whole film suffered from endless tinkering. Ironically something everyone gives George Lucas tons of grief for. I would recommend this film as a \"how not to\" endlessly overanalyze your pet project. Make sure you really have a worthy story to tell, also, make sure you have any ending that is impactful. Something I feel 'The Fabelmans' fell short on too...","rating_value":"4","review_date":"12 February 2023","reviewer_name":"jasonforno","reviewer_url":"/user/ur31140108/","short_review":"Falls short of what it advertises","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw8867991"},{"full_review":"","rating_value":"9","review_date":"18 September 2023","reviewer_name":"bvlllloyd","reviewer_url":"/user/ur2279338/","short_review":"Low Budget Masterpiece!!!","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw9329864"},{"full_review":"","rating_value":"10","review_date":"7 May 2023","reviewer_name":"dolbywilliams","reviewer_url":"/user/ur150251002/","short_review":"One Of My Favorite Movies Of All Time","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw9040039"},{"full_review":"","rating_value":"10","review_date":"24 February 2023","reviewer_name":"collin3000","reviewer_url":"/user/ur5057565/","short_review":"One of the uniquely best movies I've ever seen","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw8889569"},{"full_review":"","rating_value":"2","review_date":"27 May 2017","reviewer_name":"12B1P","reviewer_url":"/user/ur0336711/","short_review":"A Frenetic Mess","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw3717400"},{"full_review":"This movie captures a time in the late 1970's before the world changed and legions of sci-fi fans took to the streets.

Amir Naderi is responsible for lending creation to many 'foreign language' films. Together, they take the literary classic Fahrenheit 451 and burn it to ashes, defiling the very existence of Rad Bradbury. The works of Bahrani and Naderi have always catered to a specialty niche, but these two have no clue how to deliver a presentation for mass appeal. Although no film can capture every letter of every sentence of every page of a book, Bahrani and Naderi decided to just cast aside the majority of the original Fahrenheit 451 in favor of their own interpretation of how Fahrenheit 451 should be presented. There are many folk at HBO FILMS that need to be looking for another job for allowing Bahrani and Naderi to bastardize a literary classic. Now, Michael Shannon is one of the greatest accomplished actors of the 21 century with a huge range of unique characters portrayed, yet in Fahrenheit 451 his Captain Beatty is a 'paint by the numbers' portrayal-not too much, not too little, just enough to get paid and go home. In contrast, there is Michael B. Jordan, who plays the same damn limited range character in every one of his films. Please stop casting Michael B. Jordan unless your film requires a limited 2 dimensional character. Meanwhile, the expertise of Khandi Alexander was limited and confined. In summary, if you have read Fahrenheit 451, you will be offended by this film. If you are looking for a writer, producer, director for a film that will appeal to a large audience, avoid Ramin Bahrani and Amir Naderi.","rating_value":"1","review_date":"21 May 2018","reviewer_name":"PurpleCrayon2014","reviewer_url":"/user/ur54365496/","short_review":"If You're Going To Reimagine A Classic, Then Use Classic Imagination","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw4172575"},{"full_review":"As a massive fan of the novel, I was eager to see how it was going to be adapted using today's effects.

In this movie, the books are simply translated into emojis, which, within the first seven minutes of the film, completely negates the central theme of the original novel. \nSome other broad observations: The main character, originally a very quiet and unsure person, is depicted as a gregarious and zealous. Important supporting characters have been completely cut out, and the worst of it is, it's not even a good movie on its own. There is next to no set-up before the film starts off with characters fighting against something that wasn't even very clearly stated.

Nowadays, it is praised when a black women wears her natural hair, all it took is for us to have more confidence in our natural state.","rating_value":"10","review_date":"28 August 2021","reviewer_name":"francoischristana","reviewer_url":"/user/ur48432998/","short_review":"I love this movie!","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw7279556"},{"full_review":"I cant put my finger on it but this was sooooo CRINGE. i couldn't even hate watch it.

Ricky Whittle was underutilized big time in this role....I mean come on, \"American Gods\".While I loved Ernie Hudson as always, Sanaa was missing \"something\" in this movie too me. her role felt way too similar to her Kenya McQueen in \"Something New\". and while I like Lyric Bent, they had zero chemistry. He would have been great with Grace from Greenleaf...or someone, but I just wasn't into them as a couple. His little girl was annoying and I found it hard to believe that she and Violet would still see each other socially after her Dad and Violet cooled things off. This movie felt cheap. Sanaa did not bring her A game at all. I loved that she went bald and natural for this movie and I could relate to the high and lows of emotions she felt during her big chop, but other than tgat...this movie did nothing for me. At all.

I think that is the one drawback of the film, with such a stellar cast he had to give everyone time and the movie boasts a runtime of 2:24 minutes. A bit lengthy for a crime drama/who done it because there will be slower portions of the film.

No one displayed annoyance, made fun of him, or called him insulting names to cast aspersions about his intelligence. His repetitive touching of people on the shoulder as he faced them ought to have caused women to back away and men to knock his block off. They did neither.

The storyline tells the tale of a man with Tourette's syndrome, and a group of men he grew up with that now operate a private detective firm. When the owner of the firm is murdered, despite orders from new leadership, the man with Tourette's syndrome will stop at nothing to uncover who killed his boss. He finds a trail that leads straight to the top of New York City that puts him and his friend's lives at stake as he digs deeper into the case. This movie is directed by and stars Edward Norton (Keeping the Faith) and also stars Bruce Willis (Die Hard), Alec Baldwin (The Departed), Ethan Suplee (Mallrats), Willem Dafoe (Platoon) and Gugu Mbatha-Raw (Beauty and the Beast). The storyline for this is very intricate and well told and reminded me of a poor man's Usual Suspects in some ways. The settings, attire, props and cinematography are absolutely outstanding. The depiction of New York and the complexities of the rich and politics at the time are brilliantly depicted. The writing is also very good as I loved the dialogue, metaphors and interactions between characters. The various subplots do a good job of weaving together and leading to a solid conclusion.

My opinion on slow burn shows/movies, especially if they're emotionally draining, dark or thought provoking and that require you to immerse yourself in them to appreciate them is, you have to put yourself in the right headspace to enjoy them. Unlike comedies for example, you don't have to prepare yourself to laugh, while if you want to watch a film that sucks the life out of you you have to mentally prepare yourself for it, like hey I'm about to go through an emotional roller coaster and turmoil. I could speak for myself but I don't think you have to be feeling low to enjoy a sad movie, sometimes I'm just amazed at how good the performances are to bring out those feelings from you.

This is a full-blooded portrayal, beginning with Frey at rock bottom as he collapses after a crackfuelled party session. Bundled on a plane by a doctor - destination: a Minnesota rehab facility - he wakes up mid-air, immediately stealing a whisky miniature from the hostess trolley, downing it furiously. Taken to the clinic by his concerned brother (Charlie Hunnam), Frey has no wish to recover and hates the facility's 12-step programme, showing contempt for others there, including the seen-itall counsellor (Juliette Lewis). His antiauthoritarian streak leads him to another troubled soul, former teen prostitute Lilly (Odessa Young), though their secret assignations inevitably lead to more pain.\nMore volatile than other recent addiction tales (Beautiful Boy, Ben Is Back), this film has a raw energy to it, putting Taylor-Johnson (the director) squarely back on more interesting terrain than her 2015 bonk-buster Fifty Shades Of Grey. Featuring fine work from Billy Bob Thornton as a flamboyant addict prone to dispensing pearls of wisdom, and an electric ATJ at his most grizzled, this is the sort of film where you just can't say no.","rating_value":"8","review_date":"30 November 2019","reviewer_name":"babybuletgani","reviewer_url":"/user/ur51057005/","short_review":"Whatever the truth of Frey's recollections","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw5289768"},{"full_review":"Anyone who gives this movie less than an 8 is obviously an Addict in complete denial, or you have no idea what real addiction is.

The action unfolds in the year 2563, after an Armageddon referred to as \"The Fall,\" otherwise known as \"The Great War,\" has devastated Earth. The eponymous heroine is a formidable cyborg warrioress, abandoned to rust on a scrap heap, who fears nobody and nothing. Miraculously, Dr. Dyson Ido (Christoph Waltz of \"Inglourious Basterds\"), a bespectacled cyberphysician, rescues her remains, and then revives this 300-year old combatant. Like Rodriguez's previous, mature-themed, actioneers \"El Mariachi\" (1992), \"Desperado\" (1995), \"From Dusk Till Dawn\" (1996), \"The Faculty\" (1998), \"Once Upon A Time in Mexico\" (2003), \"Planet Terror\" (2007), \"Machete\" (2010), \"Machete Kills\" (2013), and \"Sin City: A Dame to Kill For\" (2014), \"Alita: Battle Angel\" qualifies as a triumph of style over substance. Each of these B-movies is the equivalent of cinematic junk food. Fast-paced, outlandish, but diverting nonsense, these nine guilty pleasures are ideal if you find yourself plagued by insomnia. Rarely does Rodriquez fail to deliver. The combat scenes in \"Alita\" rival those in the Keanu Reeves' classic \"The Matrix.\" James Cameron, who has helmed masterpieces, such as \"The Terminator,\" \"Aliens,\" \"The Abyss,\" \"Titanic,\" and \"Avatar,\" co-scripted the screenplay with \"Terminator Genisys\" scribe Laeta Kalogridis. Reportedly, Cameron bought the rights to manga writer Yukito Kishiro's \"Battle Angel Alita\" (1990) and then sought to direct it himself. The success of \"Avatar\" and the pressure of directing four \"Avatar\" sequels forced Cameron to shelve Kishiro's manga heroine. Happily, Rodriquez stepped in and took the helm, with Cameron doing double-duty as writer & producer. Manga fans will be pleased to learn \"Alita\" preserves a substantial part of Kishiro's characters and conflict. Of course, Rodriquez has toned down the horrific gore from the source material to avoid an R-rating. You won't see Grewishka sucking the brains out of his enemies as he did in the manga.\nAfter he resurrects Alita, Ido equips her with a cyborg body which he had designed initially for his crippled but now departed daughter. Alita awakens the next day and admires the lovely designs that adorn her new body. Ido tells her she is 300-years old, and he explains she was a battle warrior like none other in the universe. As in the Jason Bourne thrillers, Alita remembers nothing from her past, until she engages in combat. Nevertheless, our heroine doesn't know what to make of these fleeting memories, especially when she performs the ancient, martial arts, fighting technique \"Panzer Kunst.\" Once she shifts into full-combat mode, Alita is not to be toyed with, despite her petite stature. In some respects, Alita's repeated clashes with an obnoxious, overbearing, part-human/part-cyborg colossus, Grewishka (Jackie Earl Haley of \"Watchmen\"), imitate the Biblical story of David & Goliath. Alita never backs down from any fight. Later, when she is reduced to little more than a head and torso with one arm, she refuses to capitulate to Grewishka. By far, Alita ranks as the most pugnacious female warrior cyborg you'll ever see in any movie. She can make fools of her opponents, such is her acrobatic skills and timing. At one point, Grewishka acquires a weapon which transforms each finger of his mechanical right hand into flying chains with grappling hooks that can be deployed at supersonic speed against an unsuspecting opponent. Indeed, Grewishka is one of Alita's chief adversaries.\nAfter Alita acquires her new set of limbs and legs, she learns more about Iron City, Zalem, and Motorball. A war has decimated Earth, and only one gigantic, airborne, saucer-shaped city out of ten has survived, and it is called Zalem. The Earth itself resembles a sprawling wasteland, and Zalem has built a factory and farms on the land beneath it to supply and nourish its hopelessly affluent citizens. The multi-lingual metropolis of Iron City lies beneath the shadow of Zalem, and the refugees of this holocaust have gathered from all parts of the Earth to settle beneath it to provide for the floating city. Gigantic tubes that anchor the flying city to the terrain are designed to transport cargo to Zalem. Literally, Zalem constitutes a heaven on Earth. Naturally, everybody dreams of ascending to Zalem, but immigration is strictly forbidden. Zalem has combat measures to repel any attempts to breach it. In this respect, \"Alita: Battle Angel\" resembles the Matt Damon & Jodie Foster sci-fi saga \"Elysium\" (2013) where disenfranchised minorities struggled to enter the city orbiting Planet Earth to take advantage of its life-saving medical treatments.\nNot only does \"Alita\" allude to \"Elysium,\" but it also features a sport reminiscent of \"Rollerball\" (1975) starring James Caan as well as the 2002 remake with Chris Klein. In both versions of \"Rollerball,\" everything revolved around a futuristic sport called Rollerball, a souped-up version of roller derby, with life and death outcomes which mimicked the mass hysteria that galvanized ancient Roman audiences during their bloodthirsty gladiatorial tournaments. Supposedly, only the greatest player in the murderous sport of Motorball has a chance to ascend to Zalem. The harrowing Motorball scenes are among some of the most exhilarating, with a wide variety of cyborgs careening around recklessly as if they were competing in a demolition derby. These cyborgs resemble refugees from a \"Transformers\" escapade. Not only does Alita tangle with the minions of a tyrant, Vector (Mahershala Ali of \"Green Book\"), who supervises Motorball betting, but also with an omniscient overlord, Nova (Edward Norton), who manipulates Vector from Zalem.\nAltogether, watching the above-average \"Alita: Battle Angel\" is a lot of fun. When Rodriquez isn't dazzling us with the staggering, CGI-laden, gymnastic battles, he trots out an impressive cast, including Jennifer Connelly, Ed Skrein, Rick Yune, Jeff Fahey, and Jai Courtney, with Michelle Rodriguez performing a voice-over in Alita's memories. Produced for a mind-blowing $170 million, \"Alita: Battle Angel\" concludes on a promising cliffhanger. Whether or not a sequel ensues will depend entirely on its box office statistics.","rating_value":"8","review_date":"6 March 2019","reviewer_name":"zardoz-13","reviewer_url":"/user/ur2079400/","short_review":"An Above-Average Anime Epic","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw4701635"},{"full_review":"","rating_value":"10","review_date":"14 February 2019","reviewer_name":"warren-87235","reviewer_url":"/user/ur61982894/","short_review":"Forget the glut of bland superhero movies... just watch Alita!","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw4657198"},{"full_review":"I'm a 47 year old man who went to film school.

And they couldn't have cast Alita more perfectly, even if her on-screen form is completely digital. Great movie. Tons of fun.

I appreciate the production team took their time to do the research of the original serials. The adaptation is great, they filtered out few \"acquire taste\" and swapped in elements that would make much more appeal to general public. The film really kept true to the original manga and reassembled almost everything from the manga the scenes, mechanical bodies, characters and the world they lived in. They did a great job on capturing Alita's slightly na√Øve stubbornness, the \"all in or all out\" euthanasic, and the pursuit of who she is.\nStorywise, the film ingeniously weaved the first 11 books of manga together, brought up few events that was happening in the 2nd chapter of Alita's adventure to the 1st movie. Which is nice since I bet they're already thinking of the next Alita movie. But as few of Cameron's work, the dark side and the ugliness of irontown wasn't rendered enough. The lack of depth on the ugliness made the whole plot a bit light, the emotional conflict wasn't intense enough and the romance plotline which is very important in the 1st chapter a little bit lack of depth.\nThe overall CG is stunning. Other than the wanted flyer and the parasite's face the rest of CG is absolute marvelous.\nAll in all, definite a great Gunnm movie, will definite watch it again and again till the sequel is out!!!","rating_value":"8","review_date":"16 February 2019","reviewer_name":"soultakerneo","reviewer_url":"/user/ur22845170/","short_review":"The Gunnm I liked","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw4660702"},{"full_review":"","rating_value":"6","review_date":"2 August 2021","reviewer_name":"rahulsubsc","reviewer_url":"/user/ur24834708/","short_review":"Why end a movie just to open a possibility for another?","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw7190303"},{"full_review":"","rating_value":"8","review_date":"5 February 2019","reviewer_name":"jditch","reviewer_url":"/user/ur71354360/","short_review":"Here's why Alita is a good film - But if you didn't like Avatar, then it's not for you.","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw4627730"},{"full_review":"But the romance threw us off a bit.

That's its main problem, really. It's messy, bloated and, often, clumsy. As a result, it feels far longer than it actually is. It awkwardly races past what feels like its natural end point just to reach an arguably even more awkward 'sequel-bait' finish, simply so that it can tie off a few loose ends and, strangely, introduce and then finish off a (more or less) completely new plot-point - one that goes back on something we've seen just moments prior. This overstuffed finale is incredibly unsatisfying, especially since most of the issues that led to its inclusion are ones that could have been easily fixed. It's one of those cases where the film, and several of its individual scenes, feel both too long and too short all at the same time. Another issue with the adaptation is the fact that it doesn't feel as though it's saying anything. I don't mean in terms of overarching messages, although they're missing and would've been appreciated, but I do mean in terms of character. There are arcs but they're basic and don't seem to flow all that well. Plus, peripheral characters are often given much more to do than main ones and the plot seems to pop them in at random points. None of the picture's events really connect with each other all that well and the set-ups rarely match the pay-offs. Still, pretty much all of them are acted well enough and are visually interesting. This leads me to perhaps the piece's biggest positive. It looks great. It's as simple as that. Though our entirely CG central character could've easily resided in the recesses of the uncanny valley, she ends up as a believable, life-like and likeable protagonist whose digital nature never takes away from our engagement with her. Perhaps the eyes are a bit strange and unnecessary (as is the fact that she's entirely CGI, to be honest), but it works within the established world and isn't as distracting as I'd feared - in fact, it's barely noticeable after a couple of scenes. Sometimes, the characters who have a real-life rotoscoped face look a little dodgy, but the rest are absolutely fine if you get on board with the flick. Because of this, the action sequences work rather well and are actually the most entertaining thing about the affair, for better or worse. Most of the movie is entirely computer animated anyway, so these 'over-the-top' and more obviously digital set-pieces still seem relatively grounded and don't take away from your investment. It does feel like the filmmakers were lost in the visuals, though. The end result is intermittently enjoyable and never especially dull - even if it does get tiring towards its, frankly, terribly paced final third. It's very, very messy, however, and doesn't really seem to have anything to say, even within its own world. Apparently, this is supposed to be part one of three. To be fair, I'd be more than willing to see where the story goes. I'm not pining for a sequel straight-away, though. 5/10","rating_value":"5","review_date":"10 February 2019","reviewer_name":"Pjtaylor-96-138044","reviewer_url":"/user/ur26820801/","short_review":"Visually stunning but messy, bloated and, often, clumsy.","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw4637804"},{"full_review":"","rating_value":"2","review_date":"19 February 2019","reviewer_name":"arriva","reviewer_url":"/user/ur20489156/","short_review":"CGI instead of substance","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw4674617"},{"full_review":"I've always loved Anime, and it's always been frustrating watching Hollywood movies destroy it (Ghost in the shell). Alita however did an amazing job in fusing Hollywood and Anime. I believe it was a great story adaptation by James Cameron, breathtaking action scenes and directing by Rodriguez, and great casting. I saw this in 4DX 3D in Seoul and It was a roller coaster ride. I was afraid the movie might put me to sleep, but it kept me engaged and watching from beginning to end. I think the most important element for movies should be the ability to engage the audience and never let them go until the very end. This movie delivers. And also I am very proud of Director Rodriguez for taking on this enormous task. He put a lot on the line to make this film.\nAn interesting thing I found was for some reason I felt there were elements of John Carpenter here.\nOverall one of the best 3D films made so far.

Director Kriv Stenders has taken a big undertaking in telling this highly recognised Australian and New Zealand battle of the Vietnam War that has however been long overdue in getting a major screen treatment. He has succeeded brilliantly. The film's relentless action and attention to detail are mixed in with moving scenes of young conscripts and volunteer soldiers grappling to stay alive in order to return to their loved ones at home. Much like Peter Weir's Gallipoli the mateship ethos shines in this movie. However, unlike that film, most of Danger Close concentrates on the battle itself, and what a technically amazing film it is in presenting and creating a visceral and tense atmosphere for the audience.The performances are excellent all round but particular mention must go to Daniel Webber as Private Paul Large, his moving portrayal of a young conscript struggling and battling courageously to help his mates and himself survive, while looking forward to returning home to his fiance and family is brilliant. As noted earlier the action in this film is relentless, from start to finish, however it never ignores the humanity and futility of war through the loss of life of many young soldiers. The roll call of ANZAC soldiers who died in the battle, noted at the end of the film with their ages, makes that abundantly clear.

Australia and New Zealand have sent their soldiers to support the Americans. Many are inexperienced conscripts. After a mortar attack, a platoon of a hundred soldiers are dispatched to search and destroy any nearby enemies. They run into and are attacked by overwhelming forces. This is a solid war movie with harrowing action. The characters are mostly one-dimensional which is expected. I would have liked more from the Vietnamese side especially their strategy. They are basically the cannon-fodder Indians in an old western. I don't like one specific montage and a few acting choices. Of course, the fight ends with the cavalry arriving at the nick of time.

A lot of it works, though the story line is merely so-so, as the target audience appears to be well below the age of the average DC based film which is darker in tone. With that in mind, it probably would have been a good idea to temper some of the language to make it an all around, better family friendly picture. I didn't care much for the character of young Billy Batson (Asher Angel), his personality didn't seem right to be selected as the 'chosen one'. I actually liked his foster brother Freddy (Jack Dylan Grazer) better; he seemed to have some of the qualities, and even the looks of the young Fred Savage in \"The Wonder Years\" television program. It probably comes as no surprise that the release of this picture around the same time as \"Captain Marvel\" would confuse comic book fans who thought both Captain Marvel and Shazam were one and the same character. It even had me puzzled for a while when the titles were announced, but changing story lines, ethnicity and genders is nothing new for comic book writers looking to push the envelope on transforming existing characters. The picture is pretty well balanced between the comedic aspects of the players and the threat posed by the evil Dr. Sivana (Mark Strong) and his Seven Deadly Sin allies. The foster home setting at the center of the story was a good one to demonstrate how kids in that kind of environment can learn to overcome their circumstances and achieve personal goals and fulfillment; in that regard, teenage Mary (Grace Fulton) was a perfectly good role model. I don't know that this film would lead to an even more effective sequel, though one of the credits scenes hinted as much. I did like the final scene after all the credits rolled in which an in joke was leveled at Aquaman's expense, and the final clip in the movie proper ended things on a high note with the appearance of a faceless Superman. When the film makers follow up on this one, it would be a good idea to maintain the same sense of fun this one had.","rating_value":"7","review_date":"6 September 2019","reviewer_name":"classicsoncall","reviewer_url":"/user/ur2707735/","short_review":"\"If a super-hero can't save his family, he's not much of a super-hero!\"","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw5103679"},{"full_review":"","rating_value":"8","review_date":"4 April 2021","reviewer_name":"ajk232","reviewer_url":"/user/ur53668585/","short_review":"A Fun Diversion from the DC Formula - More Like This Please!","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw6777037"},{"full_review":"","rating_value":"7","review_date":"14 May 2019","reviewer_name":"Platypuschow","reviewer_url":"/user/ur57590728/","short_review":"Shazam!: If you've seen the trailer, you've seen the rest of the film in your head","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw4853407"},{"full_review":"","rating_value":"8","review_date":"12 April 2019","reviewer_name":"NpMoviez","reviewer_url":"/user/ur69508929/","short_review":"Nice addition in DCEU.","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw4776650"},{"full_review":"","rating_value":"4","review_date":"16 April 2019","reviewer_name":"mr_sharma","reviewer_url":"/user/ur4803434/","short_review":"Really just a TV movie so wait till it comes on TV","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw4784477"},{"full_review":"This movie brings some refreshment to a superhero genre, but still, it's nothing special, just your typical movie from this genre.

It is a pretty early career effort from German animation and experimental filmmaker Oskar Fischinger. The title already gives away what you see during the entirety of the film, so no need to further elaborate on that. Fischinger really shines in his later works through his use of color and music, most of the time very bright and colorful and the music very fast and fun too. Here he does not have these two mediums available yet. It is a silent black-and-white film and honestly I found it really boring and bland, also in terms of the animation. this is possibly the weakest I have seen so far from Fischinger. I cannot really blame him. He needed films like this to be improving and from this perspective it is okay he made it. i just would not call it a creative achievement really, which is also due to the year when this was made to and the (lack of) technical progress.

Carnival Row is one that has been cleared cut down in its prime. The 1st season set up this Magical Victorian style world. With allegories to imperialism, christianity, antisemitism, and so much more. Amazon Prime has seen fit to label season 2 as \"The Final Season\". As a way of saying they will not renew the program under any circumstances. Suffice to say, fans of the show have waited 3 years for a second series. And as one of them I think that it is a shame seeing how such care is taken in to the production quality of this program. Second only to Game of Thrones in world building/production design.

I had no expectations when I started watching it and knew nothing about it, thinking it would be Ripper Street with a touch of fantasy. First couple of episodes I was still thinking that but soon after I was utterly hooked by the believable world building and strong acting from the leads especially Orlando Bloom who shakes free of the last remaining vestiges of Legolas and gives a commanding tragic performance. The Victorian steam punk vibe is excellently bought to life and the underlying story of a displaced people struggling against prejudice and violence in a dark and hostile capital is superbly done. Clearly there are metaphors in this depiction for our own times but they are not so heavy handed as to distract from the main murder investigation that has reflections of the Ripper hunt. The answer to the murder mystery is apparent to the audience some way before the actual denouement and if there is a criticism it would be the stretch on credulity that gets us to the end in a rather hurried and over played final episode. A minor criticism though in gem of a show and I hope we will see more.","rating_value":"8","review_date":"5 August 2021","reviewer_name":"northernpaladin","reviewer_url":"/user/ur47919494/","short_review":"Splendid","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw7198895"},{"full_review":"Carnival Row is a captivating fantasy series that tells the story of a Victorian-inspired world where mythical creatures and humans coexist. The show's first season features strong performances by Orlando Bloom and Cara Delevingne, who bring depth and nuance to their characters. The world-building is impressive, creating an enchanting atmosphere that draws viewers in. The second season maintains the captivating world-building and performances, but some slow scenes involving supporting roles can hinder the overall pace of the show, leading to a rating of 7.5/10.

The storyline focuses on a world with humans, fairies , minotaurs and other mythical creatures trying to all\nCoexist. A civil war between species feels like it's about to breakout when a monster on the streets starts racking up a body count. The series was created by Travis Beachem (Pacific Rim & Clash of the Titans) and Rene Echevarria (The 4400 and Dark Angel) and stars Orlando Bloom (Lords of the Rings), Cara Delevingne (Suicide Squad), Tamzi Merchant (The Tudors), David Gyasi (Cloud Atlas) and Jared Harris (Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows). This is another HP Lovecraft adapted story that is a bit of a mix of Legend (my favorite Tom Cruise movie) and Game of Thrones. It's a fairytale format with different species, families and cultures that intertwines murderous monsters, beasts with great fight scenes and a who done it primary plot. This is more of a fantasy thriller than horror, but those two things sound like cousins to me. I'd recommend this if you're looking for a new series to watch and I'd score it a solid 8/10.","rating_value":"8","review_date":"10 May 2021","reviewer_name":"kevin_robbins","reviewer_url":"/user/ur131783850/","short_review":"I'd recommend this if you're looking for a new series to watch","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw6898690"},{"full_review":"","rating_value":"9","review_date":"31 August 2019","reviewer_name":"ChangoMutney","reviewer_url":"/user/ur1003598/","short_review":"Leave politics at the door","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw5091202"},{"full_review":"","rating_value":"1","review_date":"17 March 2023","reviewer_name":"ggkykpbp","reviewer_url":"/user/ur149045652/","short_review":"Absolute rubbish is season 2","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw8935180"},{"full_review":"This TV series has it all.

The performances are spot-on. Orlando Bloom gives his most mature, nuanced performance yet, and Cara Delevingne's exceptional portrayal of a fae (fairy) is alone reason to watch the series. Jared Harris raises every scene he is in, as always, and David Gyasi's is outstanding in perhaps the show's most complex role. The emotional writing creates a fully realized world.

In my opinion, Jared Harris is miscast as Absalom - it didn't work for me at all. The specific comments about the lack of chemistry between Bloom and Delevigne are not over exaggerated initially.\nHOWEVER...you start to see the chemistry growing eventually, especially in the later episodes. I was really feeling it between them by the end. You start to realize that Philo is a \"broken thing\" and he's shutdown to a lot of the world which explains Blooms approach. Unfortunately things get started clunky and slow and many critics only watch the first few episodes.\nOutside of the two mains, there are other relationships that have easily guessed but fun storylines to watch, especially Imogen and Agreus.\nBy episode 6 (which is definitely very late in the season) it felt like a lot of things were starting to click.\nGIVE THE SHOW A TRY!

Cable and streaming services have fallen into a habit of front loading their series with salacious content and unnecessary nudity to grab an audience rather than relying on their audiences' higher functions to engage with their premise for a story. This definitely did the former. However, three months later, I decided to push past the inauspicious beginning to see if there was anything worthy of attention. I'm pleased to say I found it. Fantasy is a favourite genre of mine and this series has great world building using some archetypes from folk lore. The characters were interesting. I don't agree with the reviews that say Orlando Bloom and Cara Delevingne gave poor performances. I believe that the intensity they brought to their characters was confused with wooden portrayals. These character had internal motivation to be intense. The social commentary is obviously paralleled to prejudices, pitfalls and conflicts of the socio-political climate of our day and our history. No matter whether you agree with the views of the writers, it open a point of comparison. The CGI and ambient effects were captivating. Prague brought all the right architectural undertones to house the series. The mystery was intriguing. The production was well resourced.

Think Hacksaw Ridge, meets Saving Private Ryan without all the gore. It's not about the nations, the generals, the guns, or the tanks- it's about the people. The Last Full Measure is a Drama that happens to be a war movie. Plus, you have never seen performances like those given by William Hurt, Ed Harris, Sam Jackson, Diane Ladd, and Chris Plummer. I got to see the movie at a special screening in Washington DC, and the entire audience, including military brass, had tears running down their cheeks by the end. And, trust me, they weren't tears of sorrow-It leaves you with a feeling of joy and gratitude for any solider who places themself in the line of fire. Anyone who doesn't appreciate this film has no empathy. I would highly recommend seeing this in theaters, not just for the action, but to fully appreciate the nuances in these actors' eyes.

I would also like to note, that Diane Ladd played Alice Pitsenbarger but Alice Pitsenbarger was not Williams' mother. His mother passed away in 1991. Alice was his fathers 2nd wife.

The Dirt is a pretty formulaic rock biopic about the notorious Motley Crue. As a fan of the band, I was definitely interested in seeing their debauchery detailed on film. While there is some fun to be had enjoying the music and craziness, the movie just doesn't go far enough in covering their absurd exploits. There's too much condensed into too small of a window.

None of that bothers me. To me, this is the right kind of awesomely cheesy. I'm impressed with the actors in this film. They inhabited the personas of Vince, Mick, Nikki, and Tommy really well. And I think that was the idea. Lastly, I've always resonated most with Nikki and seeing his childhood trauma depicted on the big screen was deeply moving.

Although interesting, season 1 was forgotten, as I hadn't read the books and had little involvement in the story, which is complicated and takes some work to follow along. But, this season showed how the investment paid off. True to its story (whether it follows the books at heart, I don't know), this show is unforgiving to the characters, for the sake of the narrative. It's high sci fi with a deep message about humanity. I've listed Asimov's works in my reading list, and I look forward to enjoying its source material. You needn't have read the books, which were written in the WWII era, to know that characters and relationships have been updated for a modern audience. Progressives will appreciate this, as good science fiction never lives in the past. Even though this story starts off feeling a little too big for itself, it certainly had the right to do that, and it does eventually get to filling its own big shoes. You just need to be patient. I recommend watching the last 2 episodes of season 2 in one sitting for the full impact.","rating_value":"8","review_date":"10 February 2024","reviewer_name":"sherylchilders82","reviewer_url":"/user/ur52857391/","short_review":"So far really unique & magical","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw9613618"},{"full_review":"","rating_value":"9","review_date":"28 July 2023","reviewer_name":"simongrierson","reviewer_url":"/user/ur26624423/","short_review":"Terrible adaptation but good sci-fi show","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw9221554"},{"full_review":"","rating_value":"6","review_date":"16 November 2021","reviewer_name":"dwarol","reviewer_url":"/user/ur0006147/","short_review":"It should never have been a Foundation adaptation","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw7552364"},{"full_review":"","rating_value":"8","review_date":"12 January 2024","reviewer_name":"jon-oivind","reviewer_url":"/user/ur29345581/","short_review":"Great sci-fi, some great and weak casting","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw9557638"},{"full_review":"","rating_value":"6","review_date":"24 September 2021","reviewer_name":"gaspyy","reviewer_url":"/user/ur18845072/","short_review":"Disappointed","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw7375672"},{"full_review":"I have always been an avid Sci-Fi fan.

It follows the epic saga of exiles who try to save the legacy of humanity as a galactic empire crumbles. Yet, this isn't even close to a 1950s version of that. It's modern, and everything I'd want it to be for me now. The series is mind-blowing phenomenal, with superb direction, a remarkable cast, absolutely stunning effects and unparalleled world building. The writing captures the essence and scope of the novels from what I remember feeling after reading them all, yet I hardly remember the details I read 30+ years ago. So, I won't even try to nitpick where the show diverges from the source I loved - it really doesn't matter. The cast is composed of supremely talented actors who portray complex and diverse characters. The effects are impressive, creating a realistic and immersive world of the far future. Foundation is an absolute must-watch for any sci-fi fan who wants to enjoy a contemporary take on what perhaps defined what sci-fi is, through a thrilling and intelligent story of human destiny.

However, it is arguably one of the most influential SciFi works (Does Dynastic Galactic Empires ring any bells for you? DUNE? STAR WARS?). Showrunner David S Goyer has proposed an 8 season arc for this fledgling project and if season one is any indication, this series has legs. It is beautiful, it is grand in tone, it gives us a core group of characters that span the massive time line, it has a talented cast giving layered performances and it has already been renewed by Apple TV+ For a second season.

The cast or the script. All the characters, the ones from the Novell and the new added ones, are introduced so slow and wodden. Especially the hero's! Leon A. Feels nothing like in the books. And the worst is Johansson. Completely over acting but giving nothing likeable. First episode includes way too many characters, which they don't explain. You don't know whom too follow. Ok it's TV - but the VFX is so poor. That's far away from the standard. But all this aside, the producers show that they didn't get the story and the fascinating telling from the Novell. It's about a global massive catastrophe!! The series feels like a small fisher town gets in trouble. The Novell is superb structured, and the series is not. Is not that they don't have budget.

Even David Wenham struggled, unusually.

I went after reading the book, so could fill in the gaps of the story with my reading of the book. The film was different in some important ways, notably the ending was changed and was weak.. Of course the landscape and filming was awesome, however as a West Australian the use of Esperance as a location was unexpected as obviously it was written about north of Perth at Lancelin, so it missed the point of where Winton was writing about. The genuine Australian actors were under-utilised which contrasted with Hedlands inability to speak in a believable Australian accent with weird blurting in an Irish accent. Yes he was handsome but why use an American when we have so many great actors. The story line did not flow particularly well and that was probably the biggest problem.... trying to convert a great read into a great watch.

There's virtually nothing there, it's painfully average and half-assed as hell! Something that almost immediately bothered me about it was that everything in the first half felt horribly rushed and wafer thin, in terms of things like character development and motivations and characters that you actually cared about for that matter.. General buildup cohesion and emotional payoff of the story, pathos and all-important deeper dark themes of death grief horror and madness that the first movie integrated into the story and brought to the screen so well..this modern thing here to me doesn't come close to the original picture or book, oh no it does not! You know a lot of these reviews seem to me to consider this a better movie purely based on it being new, and that really makes me a little sad! Ok so I won't say that the acting was bad because it mostly wasn't, with the big exception for me being the distractingly Punch-like Jason Clarke, the guy is a horrible actor who has the emotional presence of a block and his interpretation of the Louis Creed character is just very off putting and not particularly even likeable at all.. In the vastly superior original, when Louis fails to save his little infant son in time from the truck on the pitch perfect sunny day that strangely made the event even more horrific? How he reacted, that scream? That was real mental anguish that you could feel and that hit you hard on display, this film had almost nothing to it in terms of emotional depth and grief you can feel, there wasn't any of the kind of all-consuming, maddening grief that would drive a father to dig up his own dead child to see here, he just did it without a second thought, there was no finesse or subtlety to it, the parents barely seem to grieve at all here, that felt rushed and tossed aside like everything else in order to get to the bloodshed, which by the way really wasn't anything to write home about.. On a positive it does have some solid performances, Jete Laurence was very impressive and she did her job perfectly, being sweet enough that you felt sad for her death and then effectively wicked and hateful enough that you were quite ready to see her die again! Very creepy moment with her and her dad when he's just cleaned her up after seeing her after her resurrection and he's lying next to her in bed and she speaks to him about what's in her head and where she's been after she died. I also thought it was a legit great moment when Rachel is nearly dead and the evil thing that was once her child is taunting her and she turns to her/it and says \"Don't call me mommy, you're not my daughter, Elle's dead...\" I loved that line, it really summed everything up and I could feel it because the damn movie actually slowed down for a moment and let me. Amy Seimetz I liked a lot too, she was really good and sympathetic. I love John Lithgow, he's always been nothing less than a class act as an actor...But he was no Jud Crandall. He did what he could with the role but he just immeasurably paled in comparison to the iconic performance of the late Fred Gwynne, that guy arguably MADE the original movie what it was, even I'll admit that. I didn't like the ending with the silly resurrected whole evil family all together and about to prey on poor little helpless Gage... That was just bonkers to me, what a trite and cheaply nasty way to end the movie. \"Beep beep!\" Nice. So it had potential and wasn't the worst remake that I've ever seen, but I'm not planning on seeing this again anytime soon, it was a weak movie that had no emotional or psychological weight to it, and even on it's own merit, Pet Sematary 2019 is nothing but another average horror remake that will never be as fondly thought of and remembered as the original classic still is thirty years on, and I suspect will in fact be largely forgotten soon enough.

I'm a huge fan of the novel, and whilst I'm well aware a certain amount of artistic licence goes into putting a book onto the big screen, they changed so much of the story that it was barely recognisable.\nI understand why they changed which child was killed, you'd be hard pushed to find a toddler that can act as the living dead, but it didn't work with the older child either. In the book, the resurrected 'being' was taken over by a demon-in the film, Ellie is well aware she is dead, and she's living an unwanted 'afterlife' of which she is also aware, and it turns her evil.\nThere is no atmosphere in the film, the setting should be creepy and atmospheric, but I'll be honest, the scenes in the woods look very much like a stage set with dry ice covering the floor. It looks cheap and thrown together. The story is patchy and nonsensical in many places, it feels rushed to get to the end, and none of the characters are padded out enough for you to actually care about.\nThe one shining light in this is John Lithgow as Jud, he's incredibly well cast, but the let down with him is they didn't utilise him like they should have. One of my favourite parts of the novel is the friendship that develops between Louis and Jud, it's beautiful in places, and we learn a lot about Jud, his life, the burial ground, what becomes of anyone or anything that's buried there etc. But in the film he's just some old guy that pops up every now and then, with no real background-and there isn't a single whisper of the MicMacs and their part in the burial ground.\nI also didn't like how in the film, they justified Rachel's irritating and bizarre neuroses about death by having her be responsible for her own sisters death, that was a completely new plot line addition for the purpose of the film\nAs for the ending, I'm not even sure I have it in me to comment, the ending turned it into a pseudo comical farce-the book left me feeling bleak and slightly bereft.\nHowever, I'd like to give a special mention to the cat, the cat played his part beautifully!","rating_value":"5","review_date":"4 April 2019","reviewer_name":"sarahkaye-30024","reviewer_url":"/user/ur86263977/","short_review":"Surprising letdown","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw4762265"},{"full_review":"","rating_value":"9","review_date":"2 April 2019","reviewer_name":"Pairic","reviewer_url":"/user/ur40547513/","short_review":"A Worthy Addition to The King Canon","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw4757985"},{"full_review":"","rating_value":"4","review_date":"5 October 2019","reviewer_name":"mail-tamas-kovacs","reviewer_url":"/user/ur27393416/","short_review":"A movie about a completely normal cat and his a irrational family","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw5164991"},{"full_review":"","rating_value":"3","review_date":"9 May 2019","reviewer_name":"Platypuschow","reviewer_url":"/user/ur57590728/","short_review":"Pet Sematary: Yet another remake that should never have happened","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw4839688"},{"full_review":"I saw this yesterday in RPX:Regal Premium Experience which added to the already chilling & incredible sounds!

Though the pacing of the film may seem a bit slow at times, when the film picks up its feet, it grabs your heart easily and makes for one of the most enjoyable horror flicks of recent days. Nearly every actor in this film deserves some credit, especially that of John Lithgow as Jutt and Jason Clarke as the father of the family. The daughter also does a pretty great job at her truly horrifying and changing character, and Church the cat once again remains a very prominent horror figure. The music in the film provided for some fabulous suspense, and the overall look captured was unique and quite fitting. In all, Pet Sematary may not be the most original film this year, or the most unpredictable (as the trailers pretty much spoiled everything), but it certainly is an interesting ride, and provides an experience that is nearly unforgettable.\nMy Rating: 9/10","rating_value":"9","review_date":"7 April 2019","reviewer_name":"aidanratesmovies","reviewer_url":"/user/ur48282208/","short_review":"A Unique and fun remake","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw4768028"},{"full_review":"Best horror movie of 19 so far! Refreshing movie with a story which is not spliced with over bearing nothing to do with movies development with politically correct story messages. Thankfully, there is no cheap made for t v over dramatic moments. Wisely avoids having any social awkward characters that drag the story down. Larry David would not fit well into the stories script lol! Pet Sematary is a well crafted story/horror movie which has believably well crafted character development. Pet Sematary has King's legendary story of bringing back to life the dead, with the catch of the dead being different/evil. What make's Pet Sematary work is the character development of the believable no- spiritual doctor's scientific mind could not deal with the cursed soil narrative. The wife's past guilt/spiritual belief is the counter narrative, which would take all the warnings the doctor could not understand creates character pathos. The neighbor character drives the remake forward, aka history repetes itself for the tragic story.

I haven't seen the first adaptation of the novel, which came out back in 1989, and I haven't read the novel either. I didn't watch any of the trailers and only read a brief description of the plot, so I was walking in blind in the movie. And boy, was it disturbing and terrifying, but at the same time so well made and incredibly acted.\nThe directing duo of Kevin Kolsch and Dennis Widmyer do a fantastic job at keeping the suspense alive and running all throughout the movie. It is incredibly shot with a very eerie atmosphere and great cinematography. Jason Clarke as one of the leading roles, gives an amazing performance, one which most horror movies lack, a performance with passion. However. in my opinion the real stand out here is Jet√© Laurence who plays the little girl Ellie. She does a great job on the role, and while many times kids in horror movies only ruin the scenes with their inexperienced acting, she steals the scenes, especially on the second half of the film when she's not that innocent anymore.\nThis is a great movie in my opinion, one of my favourite horrors ever, and I would recommend it day one.","rating_value":"9","review_date":"4 April 2019","reviewer_name":"Genti26","reviewer_url":"/user/ur48981195/","short_review":"Intensely terrifying","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw4761095"},{"full_review":"","rating_value":"1","review_date":"7 April 2019","reviewer_name":"CountVladDracula","reviewer_url":"/user/ur4374846/","short_review":"Stick with the original.","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw4766783"},{"full_review":"","rating_value":"7","review_date":"27 June 2019","reviewer_name":"Fella_shibby","reviewer_url":"/user/ur18970655/","short_review":"Thirty years but still no concrete fence n rumble strip for slowing down.

How Stephen King had written the script for the first adaptation, the 1989 film, was faithful to the original novel. This version, on the other hand, strays quite a bit from the novel and they decided to come up with something different. This adaptation took some things from the book that weren't included in the first adaptation, but in the end it was little. Simply, the changes in this adaptation were very lame and even the soundtrack composed by Christopher Young does not surpass that of the original film. Also, the new cover of the end credits song is far inferior to the original song performed by The Ramones in the end credits of the first film. Simply, this latest adaptation does not have the spirit of the original film or the novel and that is why I must say that it is one of the worst Stephen King movies I have seen and I am lucky that I read the novel so as not to doubt it. Pet Sematary was a work that enjoyed a glorious time on the screen, but that time has come to an end and for that I give this film a 4/10.","rating_value":"4","review_date":"14 March 2023","reviewer_name":"Elvis-Del-Valle","reviewer_url":"/user/ur139621299/","short_review":"Worst Stephen King adaptation I've ever seen","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw8927216"}]},{"ImdbId":"tt0857466","_id":"tt0857466","reviews":[{"full_review":"Once you get through the obligatory liberal white guilt and the use of ancient slavery history to bludgeon the audience there really isn't much there. 15 min in the real story begins to be told.

I've already written about this in Jazz Journal and I repeat here what I said there that everything I know about Buddy Bolden I learned from a great book entitled hear Me Talkin' To Ya in which jazz musicians who were still alive in the mid nineteen fifties reminisced about their lives to form a living oral history of the art form. Pritzker's film - clearly a labour of love - adds precisely nothing to the sparse data I gleaned from the book but that doesn't mean the film should be dismissed. We do know, for example, that Bolden was admitted to the Louisiana Hospital for the mentally ill and died there a few years later and Pritzker seizes on this as a hook to draw us into the film which is, in effect, filtered via the mind of a schizophrenic, triggered by a concert on the radio performed by Boldens' fellow (and equally real musician Louis Armstrong. Armstrong, of course, played the trumpet whilst Bolden played the cornet at the same time - the turn of the century - and in the same place - New Orleans - and is thought in some quarters to be responsible for 'inventing' jazz. Out of this slenderest of threads Prizker weaves his account of the birth of jazz and modern day trumpeter Wynton Marsalis contributes a score faithful to the sound and style of the period. English actor Gary Carr, known mostly via his roles on television, turns in a fine, albeit virtually silent, performance as the eponymous Bolden and the film is well worth seeing.","rating_value":"8","review_date":"12 June 2020","reviewer_name":"writers_reign","reviewer_url":"/user/ur2567136/","short_review":"In Bolden Days A Glimpse Of Schlocking ...","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw5817547"},{"full_review":"Taken from the perspective of Bolden's asylum residency and the reflections of his life, success, frustration and failure, I found the movie at times restless, but overall very interesting.

In reality, little is known of his music or the facts of his life, but his influence was profound and shaped jazz (jass) music.

I saw this movie last night and was really psyched for it since I was a fan of the original film. But this film didn't really deliver on the comedy like the first one did. The comedy in Super Troopers 2 felt more like conventional fart joke and raunchy humor, whereas the first film had a more prankster humor about it. I actually felt like the humor is Super Troopers 2 was a major departure from the humor in all of the other Broken Lizard films like Club Dread and Beerfest. The first film felt like the story came first and the jokes followed. This film felt like the storyline was centered around the jokes and the jokes came first. But the jokes just weren't as memorable or as funny as the first film. No funny quotable jokes. And the Mounties in the film didn't really add anything especially funny in terms of jokes. I hope that if I rewatch Super Troopers 2 on TV in a few months from now that maybe the humor will click for me on the second or third watch around. But I just didn't think the film was that funny and it felt like a totally different humor than the first film. But that happened to other long awaited comedy sequels as well. Like In Dumber and Dumber To, Harry and Lloyd came off as mean spirited and cruel whereas in the original, they were just naive and more innocent. Not sure why the comedy styling changes in the some of these sequels.","rating_value":"4","review_date":"25 April 2018","reviewer_name":"steve1049","reviewer_url":"/user/ur2638956/","short_review":"Different humor than the first film","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw4142586"},{"full_review":"","rating_value":"8","review_date":"21 April 2018","reviewer_name":"JasonR77","reviewer_url":"/user/ur52562217/","short_review":"My face hurts","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw4137813"},{"full_review":"","rating_value":"4","review_date":"25 June 2018","reviewer_name":"neil-476","reviewer_url":"/user/ur7813355/","short_review":"Possibly funnier than breaking your ankle, but not by much","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw4215525"},{"full_review":"","rating_value":"6","review_date":"22 January 2019","reviewer_name":"Platypuschow","reviewer_url":"/user/ur57590728/","short_review":"Super Troopers 2: Quite an improvement","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw4599427"},{"full_review":"This sequel was very well done and a lot of it had to do with the fact that there were no re-cast characters.

The film has plenty of hilarious moments throughout, and honestly speaking, it may be slightly funnier than the first. However, there is less of a plot this time around, and even with its often does of hilarious humor, a few jokes do fall flat- especially when some are repeated excessively. The film for the most part does a fair job with its pacing, being entertaining enough to certainly grab your attention during its long stream of jokes throughout. There is little to be impressed by when it comes to the story of the film however, and it seems to repeat old patterns just to find its way afloat, making it slightly less enjoyable than the original. Nevertheless, the process works well enough, and though it may seem a bit obvious at times what they are doing, for the most part its very funny anyway. In the end, I enjoyed the film very much, and is quite possibly one of the best sequels to a comedy I have seen in quite a while.\nMy Rating: 8.75/10","rating_value":"9","review_date":"10 April 2020","reviewer_name":"aidanratesmovies","reviewer_url":"/user/ur48282208/","short_review":"About on par with the original, quite a hilarious time","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw5627265"},{"full_review":"Going into this I was worried it was gonna be another crappy sequel that tried to hard to match the first, but that was most certainly not the case with this movie.

In tone, story, structure, and style, there are very few surprises in how everything plays out. Yet, while this may viewed by some as a weakness, it's also one of the biggest strengths of the film: a rabid desire to meet fan expectations and deliver consistent, non-stop jokes. Hardly 30 seconds go by in any scene without there being one big joke delivered, whether that be through a quip, slapstick bit, a funny callback to the first Super Troopers, or a visual gag. This would be a problem if the jokes weren't funny or Broken Lizard appeared to be trying too hard, but I would say the jokes hit 70-75% of the running time. The movie has the fun atmosphere of Super Troopers maintained, while looking slightly more polished in its cinematography, and having slightly more focus in terms of focus and pacing. Running a slim 85 minutes before ending credits, Super Troopers 2 is completely dedicated to making the audience laugh and wrapping up its story as quickly as possible. Again, maybe that can be seen as a fault, but it's refreshing to see a studio-released comedy these days that's not two hours with filler that should have stayed on the cutting room floor. This is simply a lowbrow comedy sequel made only for fans of the original, and there's no shame in that. For those fans like myself, Super Troopers 2 is probably the most rewarding, fun comedy in years. 8/10","rating_value":"","review_date":"22 April 2018","reviewer_name":"jellyneckr","reviewer_url":"/user/ur0668022/","short_review":"Worth the wait","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw4138112"},{"full_review":"Think only second time ive walked out on a film.I sat through 45mins of pain.No laughs,just shouting with pathetic attempts at comedy.Brian Cox and Rob Lowe must be so desperate for cash.Im really confused and worried that there so many high reviews.Warning avoid at all costs.","rating_value":"1","review_date":"21 June 2018","reviewer_name":"meshborg68","reviewer_url":"/user/ur47638840/","short_review":"Super Tripe.","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw4211185"},{"full_review":"Why wait nearly 2 decades just to make a crowd-funded box of crap?

Throughout the episode are random occurrences in the present, such as a hurricane that is separating Sean even further from Julia and an emotional moment between Sean and Matt.

It's more sad commentary on the unbelievable rate false confessions, corrupt and ignorant law enforcement in rural America (although I'm sure it happens in urban areas as well). Somebody commented on 4% of people being incarcerated for crimes they didn't commit? I'd love to hear what Barry Scheck, co-founder (1992) of The Innocence Project, would gauge that number to be. One person lamented how this documentary never explains how the false confessions were obtained, it has practically become common knowledge (unless you live under a rock) that suspects can be bullied, lied to (legally!), threatened in countless ways, all of which takes place off-camera or recordings are edited in favor of those doing the questioning. This is not a new phenomenon. Just look at statistics of people exonerated since the advent of DNA. I shudder to think how many people have spent years, lives and worst of all, been put to death based on false confessions.

Don't confuse the premise of poor police work and unfair incarceration with this one case that stood out so much from all the others. Also, let's not overlook the fact that 80% of cases involving people who did not commit the crime they were incarcerated for are involved in some type of shady lifestyle and would not have been suspected if they were not involved in some kind of sketchy behavior. Yes, it happens you much but a low percent nonetheless. This case stands out precisely because the guilt was hung on a coerced confession from a low IQ person who should have had a guardian with him before the initial interview and the cops knew it or should have known.

Our hero is so admirable and relatable, charged with the responsibility of raising, protecting, and otherwise caring for his three younger sisters, but in many ways, he is still a child himself, and a scarred one at that.

So be aware of that. You should look at it as a drama not a crime movie. I am not a big fan of this genre but I wanted to add a note here. This is a very important topic in our society and people need to be aware of the likely consequences of domestic violence and abuse. The movie illustrates the depth of issues one can have in a family with abuse history. While some people may find it too much, the movie does its job well to picture an extreme case.

Not to be confused with the 1981 film with the same title, starring Sally Field and Tommy Lee. Directed by Alex Pettyfer, who also played the main character: 18y.o. Harley Altmyer: oldest child and now guardian for his 3 sisters, after his father was murdered and his mother imprisoned for this murder. His 3 sisters are: 16-17y.o. Amber, 12y.o. Misty, and 6y.o. Jody. The story takes place somewhere in the boonies of western PA............. The film has its problems. For one thing, it takes too long to get going. Most of the interesting revelations and happenings occur in the second half, so that some viewers give up during the first half. But, perhaps, this is unavoidable. Alex is too old(28) for a believable 18y.o., and Nicola Peltz is too old(23) for a believable 16-17y.o.. Harley is clearly too disturbed to be acting as the head of a family. He is profoundly depressed throughout most of the film, apparently with a guilty conscience, as he mainly looks down or deviantly when speaking, and often speaks too quietly or poorly to be understood. He spends a good portion of the film whimpering, often while talking. The conversation, especially by Harley and neighbor Callie(Jennifer Mercer) is frequently unintelligible to me, which makes it difficult to figure out what is going on. ................. I will now give my interpretation of what has happened in the past and what is happening in the present. If you want to see the film, I advise you to skip this part until after you have seen the film, to avoid spoiling the uncertainty............. In the beginning, everyone agrees that the mother shot the father dead, presumably because of physical or sexual abuse of at least some of the children. However, eventually, Harley acquires reason to suspect that Misty actually pulled the trigger. Harley goes to the prison and discusses the murder with his mother. Initially, she denies that Misty was the assassin. But eventually, she blurts out that Misty was trying to kill her, but her husband got in the way at the wrong moment. I'm not convinced whether this is true. Later, when Misty and Harley are alone, Misty blurts out that maybe Harley should have done it, instead, after Harley queries that she killed dad, didn't she.? Misty is implying that their father was abusing both her and Harley. However, she states that the father was not hitting Amber. This contradicts what Harley tells his psychiatrist: that when they were younger, Amber often came into his room at night and got in bed with him, as comfort and protection against abuse from the father. Sometimes, she would fondle his privates. In the present, after Amber returned from a short stay living with her boyfriend, Dylan, when Harley awoke, he found her laying naked beside him. He jumped up in a fit of hysteria and ran into the next room. Amber yelled \"I love you\". Apparently, Amber had returned from Dylan's because he had hit her, as evidenced by a somewhat bruised eye. Although she often had arguments with Harley, she said she left for Dylan's because Harley was \"discusting\". I suspect this is a reference to Harley's affair with the married neighbor Callie, rather than any unseen romantic overtures to herself. I don't know how Amber learned of this affair. Callie was a beautiful slim blond in her 30s. Thus, it is no wonder that Harley fell in love with her, and she proved vulnerable. Perhaps she felt neglected by her husband, who never seemed to be around day or night, and perhaps she had a motherly sensual attraction to the lonely Harley. But, one time when Harley showed up in his truck, Callie became hysterical. The gist of what she said was that she was afraid her husband would eventually find out and divorce her. Thus, she wanted to end the affair. Harley blurted out \"But, I love you\". She left. .............But, later, there is a pivotal strange turn around, I don't understand. Apparently, Harley had arranged to meet Callie in an abandoned shack near the railroad(why there?). But, when Harley got there at the appointed time, he found her dead, of a gunshot wound. We see Amber not far away, with Harley's rifle, sobbing, and blurting out \"I didn't know what else to do\". Presumably, she was insanely jealous of Callie. I don't understand how Amber could have learned of the meeting place and time?? Nonetheless, Harley went to the police station and confessed to the crime. The police chief asked why he did it. Haley said because Callie refused to divorce her husband and marry him. Not entirely logical, but the chief accepted it..............Harley's traumatized psychiatrist visited him in jail. Crying, she said that she didn't believe he was a killer, that he must be trying to protect the real killer. But, he refused to alter his story, saying that he deserved to be in jail. Perhaps he rationalized his deception in that he was ultimately responsible for the tradjedy by starting the affair and insisting on continuing it after Callie said she wanted it ended.......... In closing, I will say that I found Hala Finley, in playing Jody, cute and interesting.","rating_value":"7","review_date":"7 June 2021","reviewer_name":"estherwalker-34710","reviewer_url":"/user/ur125818656/","short_review":"A very twisted tale of child abuse, illicit passions, murders, and martyrdoms","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw7007824"},{"full_review":"This is a grim and disturbing film about the very damaging effects of parental child sexual abuse years later.

I was disappointed with the ending but not because it was poor acting or screenwriting etc but just because it's not the ending I wanted to see. However, it is certainly a riveting and well thought out with deep emotion and very real topics that are often times brushed aside and not spoken about in families. This movie was all about discovering the truth in one's own family and how some of us adapt to the abuse we endure as children. This movie demonstrates so well how certain types of abuse towards children can impact them as they grow older and how it influences their personality and their approach toward life. As someone in the field of psychology, I really hope that those who watch this movie see the ramifications that are very real and appear as a result of childhood trauma. This movie is very deep and rips open a family that is highly dysfunctional at a time where everything seems to be falling apart...","rating_value":"10","review_date":"25 April 2019","reviewer_name":"TruthSeeker4Life","reviewer_url":"/user/ur50213011/","short_review":"Powerful!","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw4802309"},{"full_review":"Don't know why some users states its a bad movie., May be because of some insest contents?\nThen they are very wrong.,\nChildhood abuse led some kids to a unusual state of mind which turns their life upside down.\nEach of the character is brilliant, Acting is so real..\nNothing is wrong, Direction is amazing,\nAlex pettyfer and nicola peltz steal the whole show,\nIts a Good watch.,\nYou may get some \"hangover\" even after watching this,..","rating_value":"10","review_date":"26 December 2018","reviewer_name":"mail-subinsmail","reviewer_url":"/user/ur44862692/","short_review":"Seriously its A Fantastic Drama","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw4536400"},{"full_review":"At first the only reason that I watched this movie was Adrian Lyne as its scriptwriter. Fortunately I was right. It was a deep diving psychological drama with complicated sexual theme as we expected from Lyne. The interesting point is I watched this some days after watching Lyne's Deep Water which I liked too too regardless some apparent plot holes. The way Lyne sees the human beings attracts me. I don't take his works as shallow erotic films. He really invites us to think more deeply about neglected sexual aspects of our lives. From Fatal attraction to Unfaithful all I see is about how sexual vibes can lead the calmness of life to a fatal catastrophe as he shows repeatedly by his works. I found Back Roads a decent movie with great mind provoking content. Beside good actings the camera work is great,vdelivering smooth artistic compositions which are brilliantly matched with the essence of each scene. This film deserves much higher attention and rating.","rating_value":"8","review_date":"2 April 2022","reviewer_name":"rezakazemi2","reviewer_url":"/user/ur12827616/","short_review":"A Serious Movie","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw8027651"},{"full_review":"","rating_value":"7","review_date":"22 February 2019","reviewer_name":"natcalgary","reviewer_url":"/user/ur88373850/","short_review":"stick with this gem","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw4679231"}]},{"ImdbId":"tt0983946","_id":"tt0983946","reviews":[{"full_review":"","rating_value":"7","review_date":"26 November 2020","reviewer_name":"siderite","reviewer_url":"/user/ur3146136/","short_review":"More a Scooby-Doo movie than anything else","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw6310769"},{"full_review":"","rating_value":"2","review_date":"2 July 2020","reviewer_name":"FeastMode","reviewer_url":"/user/ur104603847/","short_review":"oozes dumbness","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw5874294"},{"full_review":"","rating_value":"7","review_date":"22 April 2020","reviewer_name":"claudio_carvalho","reviewer_url":"/user/ur2488512/","short_review":"Highly Entertaining","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw5665660"},{"full_review":"","rating_value":"8","review_date":"16 February 2020","reviewer_name":"rcnaylor","reviewer_url":"/user/ur0591150/","short_review":"C'mon people, this is a good, fun little flick","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw5488330"},{"full_review":"6/10 - despite overwhelmingly negative reviews, I was thoroughly entertained by the this off-the-walls BSC thriller even though I could have easily reduced a substantial amount of the runtime (unnecessary and dragged out storylines)","rating_value":"6","review_date":"17 February 2020","reviewer_name":"JoBloTheMovieCritic","reviewer_url":"/user/ur43949288/","short_review":"Fantasy Island","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw5489993"},{"full_review":"I grew up in the age of Fantasy Island, Gilligan's Island, Love Boat era.

Just when the action gets up some steam, we pause for extended, quiet dialog scenes that add nothing to the story. Arguably the two most intiguing characters - the zombie leader and his...girlfriend? Are given no backstory at all. The action pieces are shot well enough, but nothing is all that original or memorable. The dialog is cringe worthy in a typical Zack Snyder way. The musical choices try too hard to be clever (Elvis singing \"We're caught is a trap...\", the Cranberries classic song \"Zombie\"...) are just too on the nose to be amusing. Overall the movie is waaaay too long. By the time we hit the 2-hour mark (with another half hour to go!) I had given up caring about any of the charavters and just wanted them to drop the nuke already so I could get on with my life. Snyder fanboys will no doubt love it, as is evident by all the 9 and 10 star reviews, but for the rest of us, this one is easily skipped.","rating_value":"5","review_date":"16 May 2021","reviewer_name":"dcj2","reviewer_url":"/user/ur2538128/","short_review":"What happens in Vegas...I didn't really care.","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw6930515"},{"full_review":"","rating_value":"1","review_date":"22 May 2021","reviewer_name":"max_111","reviewer_url":"/user/ur10556502/","short_review":"I have canceled my netflix subscription after watching this.","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw6953470"},{"full_review":"We were so excited to see this this movie, and what did we get?

The first half is sooo slow. The pacing is just off, and the movie is way longer than it needs to be at 2:11. The acting, dialogue, and the leads' chemistry were flat. These are typically good actors, so a lot of the fault weighs on the script and direction (sorry Denzel). It's almost a little painful to watch in the beginning, when they are telling the love story, and all the flashbacks/flashforwards didn't help. The film finally picked up in the last third of the movie, when they focused on the mom and now pre-teen son (cutie Jalon Christian), as she started sharing with Jordan, the story of how he was born and his father's time in the army.

Also, wondered why the child/Jordan looked mixed when clearly, it's hard to imagine Michael B. And Chante producing a kid to look like he did.

The Gallaghers all working together to save Ian & Mickey's wedding. All main characters' story lines being connected and sharing a common goal. The wedding was executed excellently - emotive without being cheesy. The music and editing was brilliantly delivered, which was something that was sorely lacking previously this season. The cast is all superbly talented but Noel Fisher and Jeremy Allen White stole the show in this one. I missed Fiona and Mandy and a mention would have been appreciated but apart from that I loved that all the other Gallagher siblings for to be there for Ian as he finally married the love of his life and welcomed Mickey into the family. Even Frank seemed genuinely happy for Ian and Mickey. Hopefully season 11, being the final season, will return to the central theme of family and see the Gallaghers (now including Mickey of course) working together to each achieve their happy endings and to prove that no matter where you come from or what your circumstances are, you are not destined to repeat the same mistakes as your parents.

The biased side of me knew the episode would be good from the get-go since Ian and Mickey were taking such a big step in their love story, but I actually enjoyed so much more than just that. Yes, the wedding was done beautifully (and something worth noting is that the soundtrack for the episode was perfect), but it was the family dynamic I was longing for all season that really tied it all together. The heart of Shameless returned and it felt like the early seasons in that sense. The writers also set up many good storylines for all the main characters in season 11, and every character in the episode was enjoyable in some way whether it be the actor giving an outstanding performance or the actual character being written well.

It is great to see Barbara Crampton, an 80s horror goddess still getting work. But this film was very lacking. The writing alone caused the acting to suffer, as well as the story and plot. This was a domino effect that made the whole film suffer. With bad writing the actors never become convincing, then the paper thin story barely staggers along. Without any kind of pay off or money shot of any kind the film very abruptly ends. The whole production seemed to get off on the wrong foot and can barely stand on it's own.

Isaac along with his pregnant partner Emma go to remote Norwegian Island where Isaac lived as a child, to claim his family home. Taken at first as American tourists the locals are hostile, even violent towards Isaac but when they discover he's a native islander they get him drunk. The local police chief shocks Isaac with news about his departure from the island 25 years before, his past has changed and it will have future implications. Emma has strange dreams but to what extent are they reflecting what is really going on? The islanders are Pagans who worship a deity which slumbers in the deep waters and sometimes dreams. Sound familiar? Much of the strangeness involves water, in baths, in sinks, in the sea. Tentacles appear in the visions and dreams. White-robed Pagans participate in full immersion baptism sacraments and inveigle Isaac into taking the plunge. A couple of plot twists keep the narrative motoring along. More could have been done with a bigger budget and a more adventurous screenplay but this is certainly a watchable horror film and at 87 minutes doesn't outstay it's welcome. Co-Directed /Co-Written by Andy Collier and Tor Mian (based on the short story Men of the Cloth by Paul Kane). 6/10.","rating_value":"6","review_date":"13 December 2021","reviewer_name":"Pairic","reviewer_url":"/user/ur40547513/","short_review":"Lovecraftian Folk Horror","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw7642122"}]},{"ImdbId":"tt10004142","_id":"tt10004142","reviews":[{"full_review":"","rating_value":"5","review_date":"19 September 2019","reviewer_name":"cruise01","reviewer_url":"/user/ur57691865/","short_review":"Eh.","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw5129776"}]},{"ImdbId":"tt10004148","_id":"tt10004148","reviews":[{"full_review":"The lyrics played at the end as the former judge walked up into court tied it all up for me.

Gibbs drops the bombshell to his team at the end of the previous episode that he murdered Hernandez and they're shocked and don't know what to make of it. During this episode however Gibbs mentions that he only ever told one person previously about the murder. However, at the end of season 7 Abby solves the cold case of Hernandez's murder, linking Gibbs' rifle to the murder. When confronted Gibbs confirms the facts to Abby. So Abby knew, and by the end of season 7 Ducky, Vance, McGee, Tony, Ziva, Mike, and even the lawyer Gibbs is kinda dating all know his secret. This is reinforced in Season 8 when Hernandez's daughter and son attempt to kill Gibbs and everyone in his life, including his father. Hell, Vance even personally miss filled the cold case report in the NCIS records room.\nThe point is this, this is a serious continuity error, this is lazy writing, and this is the clearest sign yet that NCIS is well beyond its prime, it's time to bid NCIS farewell after 16 seasons.","rating_value":"1","review_date":"16 May 2019","reviewer_name":"pwolftrip","reviewer_url":"/user/ur103034755/","short_review":"Serious continuity problems, it's time to hang it up NCIS","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw4857776"},{"full_review":"","rating_value":"6","review_date":"23 May 2019","reviewer_name":"bobcobb301","reviewer_url":"/user/ur62702709/","short_review":"Lost Time","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw4882540"},{"full_review":"This episode was a bit far-fetched and I'm very tired of the Hernandez angle...

There are some who love episodes dedicated entirely to weddings. I'm not one of them. I appreciated the writers making the wedding a small part of the overall episode. That, combined with great segments, makes this one of the best BB episodes. Frank was great as usual. The dose of reality he served up for Abigail, Garrett, and Sid was classic Frank. The part where they are struggling in each other's role, and look to the other for help, but are told to pound pavement by the other was hilarious. And the small nod of the head of accomplishment when he sees them come together is Frank. Frank's short chat with Jamie was both funny (his opening joke that Jamie completely misses) and the fatherly advice he provides him touchy. The twist in the case of Danny and Baez was another interesting segment. And the coming together of Erin and Eddie was another great example of the characters staying true to their roles. Erin takes no prisoners and pulls no favours for anyone. And Eddie also showed her mettle. My 10 rating for this episode, which I don't easily hand out, factors everything above in.

One weakness, I thought, was the Danny and Baez/Rachel story. They sort of demonstrated someone else was guilty, but I didn't feel the story line was really closed off for Rachel. What I thought this episode really showed up was a question that I've been asking myself for nine years: why is Abigail Baker still a Detective? She is a woman of intelligence, competence and obvious authority. I thought in the very first season that as the Commissioner's Adjutant (which she clearly is) she should have at least the rank of Lieutenant. Frank was able to promote Sid from Sergeant without too much problem - might I suggest that both Sid and Abigail be promoted to Captain as rapidly as possible (perhaps with some equivalent nod to Garrett, who's nominally a higher level anyway), levelling the foundation supporting Frank's backup trio, and acknowledging the very equivalence of function that was pointed up in this episode.","rating_value":"9","review_date":"23 January 2020","reviewer_name":"akicork","reviewer_url":"/user/ur13998066/","short_review":"It's fine making noises about Baker's job, but will she get real acknowledgement?","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw5429198"},{"full_review":"I have watched Blue Bloods right from the beginning and feel as though I am personally invested in the Reagan family!

Spoiler alert, and please don't read this if you haven's seen the episode: it ends with Jamie waiting at the altar for his blushing bride, and the episode fades to black. Fades to black, man! And when I saw the ending, I thought \"what the hell kind of garbage is this\"? I just had the rug pulled from under me. Way to go, showrunners, way to go. Get everybody all excited and then fail to deliver. And what was the excuse? \"Ehhhh, ehhhh, we couldn't come up with a wedding that would have equaled that of Prince Charles and Princess Diana\". That's as bad as Hillary Clinton trying to explain why she lost the 2016 presidential election. I've heard some lame excuses before, but this takes it. Well, Blue Bloods isn't the only show to end this season on a bad note. So did NCIS Los Angeles. And both shows are on CBS. Which begs the question, what's going on over at the Tiffany Network? Oh yes, there's a subplot where that lovable assistant district attorney Erin Reagan interviews a witness, and his testimony casts doubt on Eddie Jenko's account. Turns out, the witness had been bribed. Sorry sack of oats. I've seen many great episodes of Blue Bloods, but this isn't one of them. The showrunners had better spend this summer thinking of a way to square themselves with we the viewers. As in, the first episode of the fall season had better be much better than this episode.

It sets out to do something positive, and the intention behind it is pure goodness. That said, I've made it through four full episodes and the whole thing still feels kind of plastic, if you know what I mean. I think the main problem is, it's too short.\nAnd I hear you...'But the series is supposed to be made of shorts, that's what Quibi is.'\nOf course, I fully realize that, but each short ep runs about 8 to 9 minutes. In each clip, we are introduced to a celebrity (Jennifer Lopez, Kevin Hart, Kristen Bell, and more) and then taken along for a hurried ride as we meet the person/family the celeb is giving the money to; and then the next person, who gets half, and then the next person who gets half of that money. The original recipient gets half of $100,000; and then break that down twice more, basically.\nIt's good and quick, but like I said, maybe too quick. The cash-giver celebs have good intentions but their explanations for why they chose a particular first recipient seem a bit repetitive and impersonal after a few episodes.\nIn my opinion, the most genuine celebrities so far are Nick Jonas, and Kristen Bell. Nick truly had a story behind his person, and Kristen Bell just has such a good spirit about her. Jennifer Lopez also came off as sweet and earnest.\nBut the last (small) thing I just can't quite get on board with is this: the third and final person in the giving chain is always told, \"(celebrity name here) started this chain of gratitude, and I'm giving this (amount of $) to you!\" No doubt the whole thing is scripted because of course it is. But that line, in every episode, just seems fake/cheap to me. There's just something kind of unnatural about that, almost like each celebrity demanded, \"I'll do this, as long as you make sure and name drop me at the end,\"\nJust seems out of place. Sure, the celebrities featured are rich, and they're a great draw, and it's always nice to have a hand in something good. But the name dropping is usually so awkwardly delivered that kind of takes you right out of it for a few seconds.\nMaybe I'm much too nitpicky and it'll improve as it goes. 99% of these 'Average Joe' recipients aren't actors, anyway... not like I can do better!","rating_value":"8","review_date":"30 April 2020","reviewer_name":"AnonymousFilmLover26","reviewer_url":"/user/ur59781307/","short_review":"Feels good, but still missing a little something","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw5692420"},{"full_review":"I love watching philanthropy such as this with mainly every day people however this continent was founded on land that much blood of the Indigenous peoples was spilled in order to aquire it. I am so happy to see the racial equity and Black Lives Matter be impacted at this time. I have yet to see and gratitude being given to the Indigenous people of the land. At this horrific time in history bodies of thousands of children are being found and the people are struggling to find resources to scan the grounds of the missions and schools where innocent babies and childrens bodies are being found. Moreover the people struggle to do dna testing to bring the children back to their home communities. Without the oppression and genocide of our people none of this money would even exist. There are so many of our people on top of this glaring genocide that do help so many of us survivors of these atrocities and crimes against humanity... where are they on this show? Please do something... anything... to help our people... In Canada alone the body count is around 4000 innocent children and they have barely scratched the surface. There were 10's of thousands of Indigenous killed in what you now call America as well... before during and after the lines are the maps were drawn. Do you have any Indigenous Actors/singers/ etc that could go spread some gratuity too? The people need hope and kindness right now so very very much... hai hai/thank you for your consideration\nKokum/grandmother Sharon Red Deer Canada (my late mother was in Blue Quills Residential School and her parents attended there too.

Avacado Toast brilliantly portrays all the struggles and reality of coming out through fantastic writing, beautiful character development and an array of brilliant actors doing a fantastic job. This show tackles many situations and subjects, and does so both sensitively and with fantastic wit. Heidi and Perry are fantastic with a undeniable connection throughout. This story was made from truth and reality, which is why it was so easy to relate to and sympathise with the characters.

I am overjoyed I did! Each of these episodes is like a little puzzle piece where we learn more about the characters we know and are introduced to new ones. We don't get the characters' stories all at once and in each episode there is at least one surprise revealed about a character. There are all ages, races, sexualities here and everyone gets both sad and funny moments. And they are funny. The humor is real and arises out of the situations, it isn't just stuck in to get a laugh. I am a hard laugh but these folks made me laugh. I will buy this when it goes off Prime because this is one I know I am missing things in and will want to watch again. The second season has all the same things to recommend it as the first season and is just as good. I like the shorter length of the episodes as I can drop in and watch a couple for a quick pick-me- up.","rating_value":"10","review_date":"20 August 2022","reviewer_name":"idasue","reviewer_url":"/user/ur107306469/","short_review":"Great characters","likesCount":0,"dislikesCount":0,"reviewId":"rw8469347"},{"full_review":"This show is amazing.
